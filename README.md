## COS110: Object-Oriented Programming

Welcome to COS110, where we delve into the fundamentals of object-oriented (OO) programming. Throughout this course, you'll explore essential concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading, memory management (including static and dynamic binding), interfaces, encapsulation, and reuse. Our aim is to equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to design sound programs, emphasizing modular code for well-structured, robust, and documented software solutions.

In this module, we utilize a modern OO programming language as the primary tool for honing your programming skills. Through practical exercises and assignments, you'll gain hands-on experience in implementing these concepts, fostering a deep understanding of how to apply them effectively in real-world scenarios. Additionally, we'll introduce you to basic data structures, including lists, stacks, and queues, laying the groundwork for more advanced programming tasks.

### Key Topics Covered:
- Inheritance and Multiple Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Operator Overloading
- Memory Management (Static and Dynamic Binding)
- Interfaces and Encapsulation
- Code Reuse
- Modular Code Design
- Documentation Best Practices

By the end of COS110, you'll not only have a solid grasp of OO programming principles but also be capable of designing and implementing well-structured programs that meet industry standards. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refine your programming skills, this module offers a comprehensive learning experience to help you succeed in the dynamic field of software development.
